**Assignments:**

1. Given a file **nodes.dmp** for the NCBI taxonomy and a file **mapping.txt** of mappings of sequence reads
to NCBI taxonomic identifiers, write a Python script to find the lineage of the mapped nodes for each sequence
read. Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the $\LaTeX$ package **listings**.
2. What is the taxonomic rank of the LCA of the mapped nodes for each of the sequence reads?
3. Do the sequence reads come from archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, or viruses?
4. Given a file **nodes.dmp** for the NCBI taxonomy and a file **mapping.txt** of mappings of sequence
reads to NCBI taxonomic identifiers, write a Python script to build the LCA skeleton tree for each sequence read.
Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the $\LaTeX$ package **listings**.
5. How many nodes are there in the LCA skeleton tree for each of the sequence reads?
6. What is the taxonomic rank of the root of the LCA skeleton tree for each of the sequence reads?
