**The task**

1. (40 points) Given a file nodes.dmp for the NCBI taxonomy, write a Python script to store it in a rooted tree. Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the $$\LaTeX$$ package listings.
2. (5 points) Is the NCBI taxonomy a rooted tree, a directed acyclic graph, or a directed graph with cycles?
3. (5 points) How many nodes are there in the NCBI taxonomy?
4. (40 points) Write a Python script to restrict the rooted tree to the seven standard taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the $\mathrm{HT}_{\mathrm{E}} \mathrm{X}$ package listings.
5. (5 points) What is the name of the kingdom taxonomic rank in the NCBI taxonomy?
6. (5 points) How many nodes are there in the NCBI taxonomy, once restricted to the seven standard taxonomic ranks?
