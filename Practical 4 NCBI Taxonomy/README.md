**Assignments:**

1. Given a file **nodes.dmp** for the NCBI taxonomy, write a Python script to store it in a rooted tree. Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the $\LaTeX$ package **listings**.
2. Is the NCBI taxonomy a rooted tree, a directed acyclic graph, or a directed graph with cycles?
3. How many nodes are there in the NCBI taxonomy?
4. Write a Python script to restrict the rooted tree to the seven standard taxonomic ranks: *kingdom*, *phylum*, *class*, *order*, *family*, *genus*, *species*. Give the code of your Python script as your answer to this question, using the$\LaTeX$ package **listings**.
5. What is the name of the *kingdom* taxonomic rank in the NCBI taxonomy?
6. How many nodes are there in the NCBI taxonomy, once restricted to the seven standard taxonomic ranks?

**Some definitions:**
 
* **Tree** is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.
* **Arborescence** is a directed graph in which, for a vertex *u* (called the root) and any other vertex *v*, there is exactly one directed path from *u* to *v*. An arborescence is thus the directed-graph form of a **rooted tree**.
* **In-degree** is the number of edges coming into a vertex in a directed graph.
